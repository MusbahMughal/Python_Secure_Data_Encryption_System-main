🔐 Python Secure Data Encryption System
This project is a basic yet effective data encryption and decryption system built using Python. It allows users to securely encrypt their sensitive data and later decrypt it using a secret key. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how cryptographic techniques can be used to protect data from unauthorized access.

✨ Features
Encrypt any text input using a custom key

Decrypt encrypted data with the correct key
Simple and user-friendly interface (CLI-based)
Uses built-in Python libraries and concepts like string manipulation and key-based encoding
Error handling for incorrect or missing keys

🛠 Technologies Used
Python 3

Cryptography basics (custom implementation, not third-party libraries)

Command-line interface
